    "\n",
    "The value_iteration python package provides an implementation of the value iteration algorithm. This algorithm is a well-known solution method for finding the optimal policy of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). \n",
    "\n",
    "For a range of problems that can be modelled as MDPs, the value iteration algorithm finds the optimal policy by maximising a value function iteratively. \n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about MDPs and the value iteration algorithm, the user can refer to Sections [9.5](https://artint.info/2e/html2e/ArtInt2e.Ch9.S5.html) and [9.5.1](https://artint.info/2e/html2e/ArtInt2e.Ch9.S5.SS1.html) of [Artificial Intelligence: Foundations and Computational Agents 2nd edition](https://artint.info/2e/html2e/ArtInt2e.html).\n",

    "- Implements the value iteration function described by the pseudocode in Figure 9.16 within [Section 9.5.2](https://artint.info/2e/html2e/ArtInt2e.Ch9.S5.SS2.html) of [Artificial Intelligence: Foundations and Computational Agents 2nd edition](https://artint.info/2e/html2e/ArtInt2e.html).\n",
    "- Includes an example of a GridWorld problem which is solved using the `value_iteration` function included in this package.\n",
    "- Can be used for any MDP with appropriate definitions of states, actions, transition probabilities, reward functions, discount factors, and termination conditions.\n"
